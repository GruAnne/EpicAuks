# EpicAuks

The data and R code in this repository was used in the statistical modelling for  "This is EPIC: Extensive Periphery for Impact and Control to study seabird habitat loss in and around offshore wind farms combining a peripheral control area and Bayesian statistics", Submitted to Ecological Informatics in September 2024.

The data consists of bird sightings from aerial surveys in and around an offshore wind park. With the R scripts we create a Bayesian spatial temporal model based on the sightings data, which is then used for a simulation study.

The goal of the study is to investigate the presence habitat loss in two auk species around the offshore wind park.

Commonly used shortenings in the code:
RB = Razorbill
GM = Guillemot
OWF = Offshore Wind Farm (similar to OWP, Offshore Wind Park)
Gemini = Name of OWP
